# concentricity [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pebble-examples/concentricity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pebble-examples/concentricity)
This is a simple watchface example that demonstrates how to build a watchface that is compatible with all Pebble
platforms (aplite, basalt, chalk, diorite, emery). It makes use of graphics APIs `graphics_fill_radial` and
`grect_inset`, as well as demonstrates how to use new defines like `PBL_RECT` and `PBL_ROUND`. The app has also
been updated to use the `UnobstructedArea` APIs.
